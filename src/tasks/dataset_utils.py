def compute_relative_distance(tree) -> dict:
    """Computes the relative distance of each node in the tree to all other
    nodes.

    This function computes distance by measuring the number of up hops and down
    hops between nodes in the tree. The distance is stored at the node level as a
    dictionary of node_id -> [up, down] where up is the number of hops to the
    common parent and down is the number of hops to the leaf node.

    For instance, given a tree:
    {
            "id": 1,
            "tree": [
                {"id": 2, "tree": []},
                {"id": 3, "tree": [{"id": 4, "tree": []}]},
            ],
    }

    The distance between 1 -> 4 is [0, 2] because 1 is the root and 4 is two
    levels down, whereas 4 -> 1 is [2, 0] because 1 is two levels up from 4.
    Similarly, 2 -> 4 is [1, 2] because 2 is one level up (1) and two down
    (1 -> 3, 3 -> 4).

    Args:
        tree (dict): A nested dictionary representing the conversation tree.
        Each node in the tree must contain a unique "id" field and a "tree" field
        containing the nested tree.

    Returns:
        The same tree with nodes updated to include the "distances" field. Note
        this is done in-place, so the return is not necessary.

    # The algorithm is a two-step process:
    # First, we calculate the distance depth first from the root to all nodes.
    # This traverses each branch individually setting the UP distance of a node
    # to the number of depth recursive calls it took to get there, and copying
    # the down distance of all the children nodes, adding 1 to each value.

    # Second, because the first process is depth first, we need to spread the
    # information from adjacent branches. Because the root node is the only node
    # with complete information, each node is missing a distance contained in the
    # root copies that distance with an additional hop to the root. This is also
